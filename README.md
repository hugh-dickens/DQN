# DQN
As part of a Reinforcement Learning module, the task was to write a deep Q-learning algorithm that was given 10 minutes to learn on a randomised course and had to reach the goal from the start location. 

The only code that needs to be run is train_and_test.py, this will extract a random environment from random_environment.py and complete the code in agent.py (which was written from scratch). After 10 minutes of training, the agent will then carry out its greedy policy. 

Full description of the DQN implementation is in code_description.png

An example for a fairly easy environment would be:
